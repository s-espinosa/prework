# Using the variables defined below, determine if you have the
# ingredients to make a pizza. A pizza requires either 2 cups
# of flour or a frozen pizza

# You should be able to change the variables to achieve the following outputs:
# When cups_of_flour = 1 and has_frozen_pizza = false, your program should print "I cannot make pizza"
# When cups_of_flour = 2 and has_frozen_pizza = false, your program should print "I can make pizza"
# When cups_of_flour = 1 and has_frozen_pizza = true, your program should print "I can make pizza"
# When cups_of_flour = 3 and has_frozen_pizza = true, your program should print "I can make pizza"

cups_of_flour = 1
has_frozen_pizza = true
