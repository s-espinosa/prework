# Using the num_quarters variable defined below, determine
# if you have enough money to buy a gumball. A gumball costs
# two quarters. Right now, the program will print
# out both "I have enough money for a gumball" and
# "I don't have enough money for a gumball". Write
# a conditional statement that only prints one or the
# other.

# You should be able to change num_quarters and achieve these outputs:
# When num_quarters = 0, program should print "I don't have enough money for a gumball"
# When num_quarters = 1, program should print "I don't have enough money for a gumball"
# When num_quarters = 2, program should print "I have enough money for a gumball"
# When num_quarters = 3, program should print "I have enough money for a gumball"

num_quarters = 0

puts "I have enough money for a gumball"
puts "I don't have enough money for a gumball"
