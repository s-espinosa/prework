# Using the variables defined below, determine if you have the
# ingredients to make a pizza. A pizza requires at least two cups
# of flour and sauce.

# You should be able to change the variables to achieve the following outputs:
# When cups_of_flour = 1 and has_sauce = true, your program should print "I cannot make pizza"
# When cups_of_flour = 1 and has_sauce = false, your program should print "I cannot make pizza"
# When cups_of_flour = 2 and has_sauce = true, your program should print "I can make pizza"
# When cups_of_flour = 3 and has_sauce = true, your program should print "I can make pizza"

cups_of_flour = 1
has_sauce = true
